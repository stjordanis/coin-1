  \class SoEngineOutputList SoEngineOutputList.h Inventor/lists/SoEngineOutputList.h
  \brief The SoEngineOutputList class is a container for SoEngineOutput objects.
  \ingroup engines
*/

// SoEngineOutputList was moved from being a subclass of SbPList to
// being a subclass of SbList. This removed the need to do lots of
// ugly casts in overloaded methods, with the subsequent removal of
// most of the code in this file. 20000228 mortene.

/*!
  \fn SoEngineOutputList::SoEngineOutputList(void)

  Default constructor.
*/

/*!
  \fn SoEngineOutputList::SoEngineOutputList(const int sizehint)

  This constructor initializes the internal allocated size for the
  list to \a sizehint. Note that the list will still initially contain
  zero items.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const int)
*/

/*!
  \fn SoEngineOutputList::SoEngineOutputList(const SoEngineOutputList & l)

  Copy constructor.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const SbList<Type> & l)
*/

/*!
  \fn void SoEngineOutputList::set(const int index, SoEngineOutput * item)

  This method sets the element at \a index to \a item. Does the same
  thing as SbList::operator[](). This method is only present for
  compatibility with the original Inventor API.
